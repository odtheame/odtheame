- 👋 Hi, I’m @odtheame but you can call me nova or randy (which is my real name) ☺
- 👀 I’m interested in software developing, it is my passion actually, I came here to show the world my adventure of becoming a full stack developer. My favorite languaje by now /*and which is the one I know the better*/ is java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end components because so far I've been working mostly on the back end part in some projects, I've been taking some courses about angular, python and rest.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many web developing projects and also would be collaborating with partners at college.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me by email, it's odtheamenova@gmail.com or LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/randycaballero/ ♥♥♥
